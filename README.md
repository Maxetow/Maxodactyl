# Maxodactyl Panel

Maxodactyl Panel® is a modern, open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go, inspired by [Pterodactyl®](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel). With a focus on security, it runs servers in isolated Docker containers and features a sleek, intuitive interface, making game hosting seamless and powerful.
