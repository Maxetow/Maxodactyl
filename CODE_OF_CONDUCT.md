# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, are committed to creating an open and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

## Our Standards

Positive contributions to the community include:

* Using inclusive and welcoming language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Prioritizing the best interests of the community
* Demonstrating empathy towards others

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory remarks, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing private information (e.g., physical or electronic addresses) without consent
* Any other conduct that is inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing these standards and may take corrective actions, including editing, deleting, or rejecting contributions, comments, or other interactions that violate this Code of Conduct. In severe cases, maintainers may temporarily or permanently ban participants.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and public interactions where individuals represent the project. Examples include official email addresses, social media accounts, or as representatives in online or offline events. Additional guidelines may be established by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior should be reported to the project team at [support@maxodactyl.io not yet](). All reports will be handled with confidentiality and reviewed to determine appropriate actions.

Failure to adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct may result in disciplinary actions as determined by the leadership team.
